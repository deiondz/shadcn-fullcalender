# Full Calendar Component

## Overview

This repository contains a custom Full Calendar component recreated from [0xBoom's](https://github.com/0xBoom) version, which I originally discovered in a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/discussions/3214#discussioncomment-10702520) about Full Calendar components made with ShadCN. Since many people are eagerly awaiting the release of [his version](https://0xboom-shadcn-event-calendar.vercel.app/), I decided to create a similar one that includes both month and year views. While it may not yet have all of 0xBoom's features, I aimed to replicate the functionality as closely as possible. Looking forward to the official release! ðŸš€

            },
            animationConfig: {
